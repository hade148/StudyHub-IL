# Security Summary

## CodeQL Security Scan Results

**Date**: December 7, 2025
**Branch**: copilot/update-react-router-flags
**Scan Type**: JavaScript/TypeScript

### Results
✅ **No security vulnerabilities found**

### Files Scanned
- `client/src/main.tsx`
- `client/src/components/ui/textarea.tsx`
- `client/src/components/summaries/UploadPage.tsx`
- `client/index.html`

### Security Considerations Implemented

1. **Type Safety**
   - Used `AxiosError<T>` type for error handling
   - Proper type checking with `axios.isAxiosError()`
   - TypeScript strict mode compliance

2. **API Security**
   - Proper authentication via JWT tokens (handled by api interceptor)
   - FormData boundary automatically generated by browser (prevents MIME confusion)
   - Server-side validation for file uploads

3. **Input Validation**
   - File type validation (PDF/DOCX only)
   - File size validation (10MB max)
   - Required field validation
   - XSS protection via React's built-in escaping

4. **Error Handling**
   - Safe error message display
   - No sensitive information exposure in errors
   - Proper error type checking before accessing properties

### Recommendations
- ✅ All security best practices followed
- ✅ No known vulnerabilities introduced
- ✅ Code ready for production deployment

### Notes
- The upload endpoint `/api/summaries` requires authentication (handled by middleware)
- File validation is performed both client-side and server-side
- CORS is properly configured on the server
- JWT tokens are stored in localStorage (standard practice for SPA apps)
